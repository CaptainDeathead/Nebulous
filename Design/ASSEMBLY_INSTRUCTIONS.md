# Quick & Easy Recipe for a Flavourful Nebulous

## Ingredients:
- 1x MCP3008 ADC
- 1x Breadboard
- 1x Raspberry Pi (any / 3a+ suggested minimum requirement)
- 1x XC4386 Arduino Compatable SD card interface module
- 4x Nebulous Controller PCB (or breadboarded equivilent)
- 40x Those specific switches (or breadboard equivilent __Only if not using the pcb__)
- 8x 33kΩ resistors
- 8x 8250Ω resistors
- 8x 22kΩ resistors
- 8x 49500Ω resistors
- 8x 132kΩ resistors
- 4x 4 pin socket (any type)
- 4x 4 pin plug (matching socket)
- 4x Generic led
- 4x Resistor matching generic led
- 1x Nebulous Base 3d Printed
- 1x Nebulous Roof 3d Printed
- 16x ABCD 3d Printed
- 16x D-Pad 3d Printed
- 8x Select-Start 3d Printed
- 4x Controller Shell top 3d Printed
- 4x Controller Shell bottom 3d Printed

## Method:
> [!NOTE]
> If not using a pcb for the controller, ignore step 1 and see the bottom of the page for alternative instructions on breadboarding.
1. For each Nebulous Controller PCB, soldier in all the buttons and resistors into their labeled positions, as well as the generic led. Soldier the ends of the positive, ground, data 1, and data 2 wires to the pcb in their respective positions.
2. Screw each Nebulous Controller PCB into a Controller Shell Bottom. Thread the wires connected to the pcb through the outgoing hole in the controller shell top. 
3. Place the ABCD, D-Pad, Select and Start buttons into the controller shell top, and carefully place the controller bottom onto the top, and pull the wires through the hole. Repeat for each controller.
4. Screw the Controller Shell pieces together using the screw holes on the corners. Soldier the wires from each controller to a 4 pin connector. The controllers are now complete.
